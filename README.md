# Quiz-Game
I have build a Graphical User Interface (GUI) Quiz Application using the Tkinter Python built-in module.The task is to ask multiple-choice questions, collect user answers and finally display the results. Before coding the GUI, weâ€™ll first see how to fetch multiple-choice questions, their correct answers, and the choices from the Open Trivia DB API. The Open Trivia Database provides a completely free JSON API for use in programming projects. Use of this API does not require an API Key.
